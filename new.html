          I know I can't give you a legit rose so this was my way of wishing you 
          "Happy Rose Day" Harshmeet! On this Rose Day, each petal symbolizes 
          my admiration <br />for you. Your presence colors my world with joy and 
          warmth.Like a rose in full bloom, your beauty captivates my heart. 
          The red roses reflect the passion of mine that burns for you. In my garden 
          of life, youâ€™re the Juliet Rose! 
 
          
          As long as the Sun glows
          As long as the water on earth flows
          My love for you would exist
          Craving for our eternal tryst
